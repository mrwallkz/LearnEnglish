<span style="padding-left: 4%">Stonehenge</span> is a prehistoric monument on an area of land called Salisbury Plain- about 7 miles north of the town of Salisbury in England.  Stonehenge consists of a series of stone settings arranged in a circle and is considered one of the most complex stone circles in the world.  Built as a religious temple, Stonehenge was first recorded by John Aubrey in the 17th century, although excavation of the site did not begin until 1919.  Research has shown that there are three main periods of construction, beginning around 1800 BC and finishing in the 15th century BC, when Stonehenge was completely reconstructed.  The fact that the monument is so large implies that many people must have worked together in a team to build it.  There has always been controversy surrounding the exact function of Stonehenge.  Although there is no doubt that it had religious importance, it was also known to have a special significance in regard to the sun.  Records show that the site was used as a place of worship during the summer months and especially on June 21st, the longest day of the year.  Today Stonehenge is a major tourist attraction and is still believed to have a spiritual force, even to this day.
