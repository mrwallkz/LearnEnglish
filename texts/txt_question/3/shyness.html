<span style="padding-left: 4%">Recent</span> research in America has shown that shyness is determined by our genes; some people are simply born that way.  Strangely enough, it’s often those people who look as if they should be most confident (tall people, for example) who are the most insecure.  The 13-year research has now identified the gene that causes shyness, and the scientists believe that in fact we are all born more or less shy.  It’s just that some people are able to deal with it better than others.  Personal circumstances have an influence as well.<br>
<span style="padding-left: 4%">Shyness</span> may not seem to be a serious complaint, but for some who suffer from it, it can become unbearable.  Even talking to a small group of people you know can seem like an ordeal- it can feel as if you’ve been asked to give a speech on a topic you know very little about to a number of experts.  You start to feel hot and shaky, your heart beats faster, your knees feel weak, you begin to stutter and the whole experience seems to last forever.<br>
<span style="padding-left: 4%">The</span> fact of the matter is that shyness is something we often recognize in others: blushing (going red) is one of the more visible signs, for example.  Yet we don’t judge someone harshly because of <strong style="font-size:120%;padding: 0 1.5%">this</strong>.But shyness does mean that you are harder to approach, so you become more   (14) isolated.  As one shy person put it, “It’s like being in a prison, and it’s very hard to break out.”<br>
<span style="padding-left: 4%">Experts</span> on the subject have come up with various possible solutions, and one has been singled out as being the key to success- namely, finding an interest in common with the other people.  Spending a lot of time on the sidelines watching other people and envying them because they are much more outgoing doesn’t help; remembering that some of those people you most envy are probably shy themselves, does.  The secret is how you deal with it.  And experts have come up with four things you can do today to help:<br>
<span style="padding-left: 4%">Firstly,</span> you can start by listening to other people. You will find yourself getting interested in what they’re talking about and asking questions- and before you know it, you’ll be having a conversation.<br>
<span style="padding-left: 4%">Secondly,</span> you could try asking neighbors if you can walk their dog.  Like children, pets can be excellent icebreakers for conversations with passers-by.<br>
<span style="padding-left: 4%">Thirdly,</span> try joining a class to learn something like tap-dancing or flamenco, where people are likely to laugh a lot.  You’ll feel relaxed, and also you’ll be much too busy concentrating on what you are doing to feel shy.<br>
<span style="padding-left: 4%">Lastly,</span> try telling yourself that it doesn’t matter if you say or do something silly.  Most people make a fool of themselves every so often- and it’s not the end of the world if you do!
