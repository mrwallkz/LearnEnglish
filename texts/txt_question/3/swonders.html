<div class="text_category">The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World</div>
<div class="text_block">
<span style="padding-left: 4%">Only</span> one of the seven wonders of the ancient world <strong>(1)… </strong> exists.  This is hardly surprising, as it is probably the most dramatic and indestructible.  The Egyptian Pyramids were built between 2550 BC and 2480 BC as royal burial places.  They stand on the West bank of the Nile.  However, the last century of human civilization has had a terrible <strong>(2)… </strong> on them, as pollution is decaying the stone.  All of the <strong>(3)… </strong> six wonders have been completely destroyed by war or natural disasters.  For example, the Colossus of Rhodes fell down during an earthquake just 200 years after it was put up at the end of the 4th century.  The statue was removed by scrap metal merchants in 654 AD.  The Mausoleum in Harlicarnassus survived <strong>(4)… </strong> .  It lasted 19 centuries, but the white marble tomb was broken up and used for building material by the crusaders in 1522.  The statue of Zeus at Olympia is now lost, but the temple in which it was housed still stands.  In recent years people have <strong>(5)… </strong>to compile lists containing the seven wonders of the modern world.  However nobody seems to be able to agree on what it should include.
